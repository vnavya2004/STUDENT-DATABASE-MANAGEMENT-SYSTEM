    <P style="text-align: center;font-size:20px;margin: 75px 0px 0px 0px;">When it comes to studying at an IIT, people have the misconception
        that IITians are studious dweebs, who can't break out of the humdrum monotony of their schedules; trapped in a
        perpetual loop of assignments, quizzes, vivas and semester examinations. With a panoply of activities organised
        under the banner of cultural and technical events, to a multitude of clubs that help the students follow their
        interests, the students gain an impressive repertoire of skills, apart from academic excellence. Whether it be
        the performance at inter-IITs, at annual TvsMs, or international competitions, the students at IITI have
        consistently shone with full brilliance. With a close-knit community of more than 1800 students, students here
        form strong and lasting friendships for life</P>

              <p class="card-text">  An alumni association is an association of graduates or, more broadly, of
                former students (alumni).

                These associations often organize social events, publish newsletters or magazines, and raise funds for
                the organization. Many provide a variety of benefits and services that help alumni maintain connections
                to their educational institution and fellow graduates. Most associations do not require its members to
                be an alumnus of a university to enjoy membership and privileges.

                Additionally, such groups often support new alumni, and provide a forum to form new friendships and
                business relationships with people of similar background.

                Vision of Alumni:

                To engage the global community to support and advance the collegeâ€™s excellence.

                Mission of Alumni

                The Alumni Association fosters a lifelong spirit of belonging and pride by connecting alumni, students,
                and friends to the college of Education and each other. The Alumni Association advocates for the college
                and its alumni with a credible, independent and collaborative voice. </p>
